INLINING OPTION VALUES:

  -inline-max-per-routine: disabled
  -inline-max-per-compile: disabled

In the inlining report below:
   "sz" refers to the "size" of the routine. The smaller a routine's size,
      the more likely it is to be inlined.
   "isz" refers to the "inlined size" of the routine. This is the amount
      the calling routine will grow if the called routine is inlined into it.
      The compiler generally limits the amount a routine can grow by having
      routines inlined into it.

INLINING FOOTNOTES:

<1> The compiler's heuristics indicate that the function is not profitable to 
    inline.  Override this decision by adding "inline 
    __attribute__((always_inline))" to the declaration of the called function, 
    or add "#pragma forceinline" before the call site.

<2> The function is larger than the inliner would normally inline.  Use the
    option -inline-max-size to increase the size of any function that would
    normally be inlined, add "inline __attribute__((always_inline))" to the
    declaration of the called function, or add "#pragma forceinline" before
    the call site.
